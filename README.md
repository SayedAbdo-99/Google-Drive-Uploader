# Google-Drive-Uploader
<h3>Description:</h3> A site to transfer files between a local server and many Google Drive accounts. I used [Google Drive API] and MySQL to make the user save multiple google Drive accounts and transfer the data to the specific account that he wants to use. I am working on extracting it as an API service that can be used through sites that want to manage between their servers and Gdrive accounts. 
<h3>Target:</h3> Improvement in managing the transfer and storage of files to and from local servers. 
<h3>Tools and Techniques:</h3> Python, googleapiclient, Google Drive API, flask, MYSQL, JavaScript, html, CSS, and Bootstrap.
